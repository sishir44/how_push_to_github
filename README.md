<h2>How Push Code to GitHub</h2>
<p>Pushing code to GitHub means to upload your project code to the GitHub.com code-hosting service. In this short article, we'll show you how to do this using Git on the Command Line. </p>
 
<h3>How to Create a Local Repository</h3> 
<p>First, you need to have a local repository for your actual project code. (If you already have this, skip to the next section below titled "How to Push to GitHub".) </p>
 
<h3>Using Git on the Command Line </h3>
<p>Open the command line ("Terminal" on the Mac, "Git Bash" on Windows) and change into your project's base directory. There, you can create a new Git repository:</p> 
<h4>$ cd projects/my-project </h4>
<h4>$ git init</h4>
 
<p>As a first step, you can add all of your current files to the repository and then bundle these in a commit: </p>
<h4>$ git add .</h4>
<h4>$ git commit -m "Initial commit"</h4>
 
<p>You can then connect this remote repository to your local Git repository with the following command:</p> 
<h4>$ git remote add origin repository_url</h4>
 
<p>The final step is to push your changes from your local repository to your new remote repository:</p> 
<h4>$ git push origin master </h4>
